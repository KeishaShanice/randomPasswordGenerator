<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
<p>Technologies used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>

<h3>In Action:</h3>
<p>User can click the "Generate Passwords" button to generate two random passwords made of characters, numbers, and symbols. User can use text box to select password length, and to include or remove numbers and symbols. Default passwords have a length of 15 and include characters, numbers, and symbols.</p>

<h2>Optimizations:</h2>
<p>In addition to project requirements, I included an option to select for numbers and symbols. I also included a clear function that clears the previous entries.</p>
